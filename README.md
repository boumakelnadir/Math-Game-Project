Math Game Project

Project Name:

Math Challenge Game


How to Run:

Download the project and open it with Visual Studio Community 2022. Simply build and run the application.


Purpose of This Project:

This project was developed as part of my C++ learning journey. Through building this interactive game, I was able to practice and strengthen essential programming concepts, including:



C++ Fundamentals: Applying principles such as enumerations, structs, functions, and input/output handling.

Code Design: Writing clean, organized, and reusable code by dividing the game into clear, focused functions.

Problem-Solving Skills: Analyzing the logic behind customizing difficulty levels and operation types, and breaking the game down into manageable tasks.

Learning Objective: Integrating programming logic with my own ideas to create a fun and practical arithmetic challenge for users.


The Math Challenge Game not only offers entertaining practice for arithmetic skills, but also demonstrates my progress in applying C++ effectively through a complete and interactive project.
