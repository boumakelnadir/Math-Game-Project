# Math Game Project

Project Overview :
Welcome to the Math Challenge Game! This project is a simple, interactive application developed in C++ that allows you to test your skills in basic arithmetic operations. It was designed to be a fun and useful experience where you can choose the difficulty level and the type of operations you want to practice. This project was an excellent opportunity for me to apply and deepen my understanding of C++ concepts practically and effectively.

How to Run the Game :
Running the game is very straightforward. Just follow these steps:

Download the project files from this repository.
Open the project using Visual Studio Community 2022.
Run the program directly.

Why I Built This Project :
This project was built to apply and strengthen my understanding of several core programming concepts:

Fundamental C++ Concepts
In this project, I used fundamental principles such as:

Enumerations (enum): To organize user options (like difficulty levels and operation types) in a clear and readable manner.

Structs (struct): To create custom data structures (stGameResult, stRoundResult) that group related game data into logical units.

Functions: To organize the code into small, focused parts, making it more reusable and easier to understand.

Input/Output Handling: Using cin and cout to interact with the user simply and effectively.

Code Design :
I focused on writing clean and organized code that is easy to understand and modify. The game is divided into separate functions, each responsible for a specific task, such as reading user input, generating random numbers, displaying questions, and comparing answers.

Problem-Solving Skills :
This project was a great opportunity to practice methodologies for analyzing complex problems and breaking them down into smaller, more manageable parts. For example, the process of choosing a difficulty level is separated from the actual question-displaying logic, which makes the code structure much clearer.

Learning Objectives
My goal was to merge programming logic with personal ideas to create a practical and useful application. This game not only offers an entertaining challenge but also demonstrates how to build a complete program from the ground up.

I hope you enjoy the game! Feel free to reach out with any questions or suggestions.
